# ECG Compression Benchmark

This benchmark evaluates the performance of ECG signal compression algorithms. Participants are required to compress ECG signals and submit their results for evaluation.

## Task
- Compress ECG signals using your algorithm.
- Submit the compressed data and reconstructed signals.
- The evaluation metrics include Compression Ratio and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
